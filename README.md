# Jellyfin for Media Center

This is a fork of Emby's MediaBrowser-Classic addon for Windows Media Center, to deattach it from Emby's centralized backend and work with local or remote Jellyfin servers.

Not much has changed as of now, but sooner or later I'll get this to work completely.

The current code is in the develop branch.
