# Jellyfin for Media Center

This is a fork of Emby's MediaBrowser-Classic addon for Windows Media Center, to deattach it from Emby's centralized backend and work with local or remote Jellyfin servers.

Not much has changed as of now, but sooner or later I'll get this to work completely.

## Github users

This project's home will be at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/samicrusader/MediaBrowser.Classic), send all issues and pull requests there.

## Building

You'll need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or the [build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16), the [Windows 7 SDK](docs\Win7SDK.md), and a machine with Media Center installed. You can use 7, or 8(.1) with the paid Media Center addon for building.

Make sure to set the target framework to 4.5.
